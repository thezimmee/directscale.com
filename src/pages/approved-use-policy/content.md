## II. PROHIBITED USES

These lists are not meant to be exhaustive, but merely illustrative of examples of inappropriate and improper conduct, which are prohibited on DIRECTSCALE products. These lists are not meant to supercede any Subscriber Agreements entered into by certain users of DirectScale products.

### Illegal Use

DIRECTSCALE products may only be used for lawful purposes. The transmission, distribution, or storage of any data or material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to material or data which:

- Infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right.
- Violates export control laws or regulations.
- Violates any parties confidentiality rights.
- Constitutes use or dissemination of child pornography.
- Is illegal or unlawful in any state, country, province or nation.

### Abuse

Users of DIRECTSCALE products must configure their systems in a secure manner. Should a users system be exploited by unauthorized persons, the user is responsible for both reporting the violation (where applicable), and then fixing the exploited system. For instance, should the security of a mail server be compromised to distribute unsolicited emails, the user is responsible for immediately re-configuring the system to prevent further unauthorized use. Users are prohibited from interfering or attempting to interfere with services (Denial of Service Attacks), whether intentionally or through neglect, of any other user, host, or network. The prevention of 'unintentional attacks', such as infection and subsequent propagation of computer viruses, are the responsibility of every user.

### E-Mail

Users are prohibited from engaging in improper use or distribution of electronic mail (e-mail). Users are strictly prohibited from engaging in any of the following activities:

- Sending unsolicited mass or commercial e-mail (spamming) for any purpose whatsoever.
- Having third parties send out commercial emails on any users behalf.
- Violates any partys confidentiality rights.
- Using DIRECTSCALE products to receive replies from unsolicited emails (commonly referred to as drop-box accounts).
- Configuring any email server in such a way that it will accept third party emails for forwarding (commonly known as an open mail relay). If a site has roaming users who wish to use a common mail server, the mail server must be configured to require some form of user identification and authorization.

Mass or commercial email may be sent only to recipients who have expressly requested receipt of such e-mails, by the sending of an email request to the person performing the mass or commercial mailings. This exchanging of requests, acknowledgements, and final confirmations (commonly referred to as a double opt-in process) must be adhered to in its entirety for any mass or commercial email to be considered solicited by DIRECTSCALE.

Users that send mass or commercial e-mail are required to maintain complete and accurate records of all e-mail subscription requests, specifically including the email and associated headers sent by every e-mail subscriber, and to immediately provide DIRECTSCALE with such records upon request of DIRECTSCALE. E-mail subscriptions that do not have a specific recipient generated email request associated with them are invalid, and are strictly prohibited.

DirectScale will allow the passing of email opt-in information as long as the subscribe date and subscribe IP information that is passed is verifiable. DirectScale will randomly check this information and confirm the source. There cannot be any subscribe IP in the DirectScale database that is used more than 3 times.

In the absence of positive, verifiable proof to the contrary, DIRECTSCALE considers complaints by recipients of e-mails to be de-facto proof that the recipient did not subscribe or otherwise request the e-mail(s) about which a complaint was generated.

### Enforcement

DIRECTSCALE will provide notice to you of violation(s) of any provisions of this policy with written notice, which notice can be provided via e-mail, fax or USPS, with the desire that you cure the violation(s). Prior to suspension or termination, DIRECTSCALE will attempt to work with You to cure violations of this policy and ensure that there is no re-occurrence; however, DIRECTSCALE reserves the right to suspend or terminate based on a first offense, after attempting to resolve the violation with 3rd party providers as required by backbone providers, SPAM regulatory services, or as required by State or Federal Law.
